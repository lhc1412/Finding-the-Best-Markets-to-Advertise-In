# Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In

In this project, I assume working for an an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of the courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. The company wants to promote the product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement. The goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in.

The data I use in the project is from [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969/). The dataset is prublicly available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey).

### Summary of results
The best market for the company to advertise in is the US market. For the second best market, it wasn't clear-cut what to choose between India and Canada.
